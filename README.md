## Useage
This random password generator will ask the user to select a password length between 8 to 128 characters. Then the user will be prompted to either select "ok" or "cancel" to confirm if they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers or symbols in their password. The password generator will then take the user input and will return a password with the selected criteria. If the user selects a number that is not within the 8-128 character parameters the webpage will notify the user to enter a number between those two values. If the user does not select any password criteria the webpage will notify the user that at least 1 criteria is required. Once the password criteria have been met, the password will then be written to the page seen in the example below.
